          Hi my name is Shiun Yee. I am 21 this year and I'm from
          Sabah,Malaysia.I am the youngest in the family and my brother is the
          reason I got into coding. I moved to Sydney last year in December and
          as you can tell from the picture I'm really enjoying my time in UTS
          although the assignments can drive you crazy. I am in my second year
          of Bachelors of Computing Science and is thinking of majoring in
          either AI and data analytics or Buisness Information Systems
          Management. I have a part-time job at a fish & chips shop so hit me up
          if you ever want some.

          <h3>Here are some things about me!</h3>
          <p>
            I really enjoy the outdoors.I love watching the sunsets(Sabah have
            the best ones don't fight me on this), hiking and anything that gets
            my adrenaline pumping. I love spontaneous trips and is always down
            for a good time. You can usually find me partying and drinking
            during the weekends but currently broke and chasing assignments now.
            I am a big fan of Grey's Anatomy and I was very close to studying
            medicine becauase of it but my mum talked me out of it.

            This is a picture of me conquering the highest mountain,Mount
            Kinabalu in Southeast Asia(literally two hours drive from my house)
            a year ago. It was a two day hike up to the peak and I couldnt feel
            my legs for three days after that. It was a really amazing
            experience and made me appreciate mother nature even more.
