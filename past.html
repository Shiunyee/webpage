          I started playing basketball when I was 15 and played numerous
          competitions in high school.I got to travel around Malaysia with my
          teammates and it was one of the best times of my life. So fun fact, I
          never had any serious injuries while playing on court but dislocated
          my shoulder when I fell in the toilet during one of the competitons
          and that hurt like hell.

          I did A-levels after graduating high school and gave tutoring during
          my free time.I've also worked in a bubble tea shop before and lasted a
          month only because the pay was so bad ($2 an hour). It was then I
          finally understood why my mum worked so hard to give us good quality
          education. I've also travelled to quite a few countries namely Japan,
          Korea, China, Thailand, Vietnam, Phillipines, New Zealand, Indonesia
          and Taiwan.
